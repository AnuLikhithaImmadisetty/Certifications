During my internship at Dell Technologies (June 3rd to August 2nd, 2024), I worked as a Data Analyst Intern. My role involved exploring large datasets, implementing data mining techniques to forecast trends, engaging in automation, supply chain management, procurement and logistics practices. I also automated the management of non-compliance orders to enhance communication with carriers using Python, PostgreSQL, API integrations, and Regrello. This initiative significantly reduced manual intervention and improved overall efficiency through a streamlined workflow, ensuring timely resolution of issues and better alignment with carriers.
### These documents officially recognize my successful completion of the internship and my contributions to the team.
